**Credit Card Default Prediction**

**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their payment. This is a critical task for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of their customers and minimize the risk of defaults.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card holders, including various features such as age, income, credit limit, payment history, and more. The target variable is whether the card holder defaulted or not.

**Usage:**
Explore the data using Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
Preprocess the data using the scripts in the src directory.
Train and evaluate the model using the provided notebooks.

**Model Building:**
We use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for credit card default prediction. We employ algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to create robust classifiers.

**Evaluation:**
We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

**Results:**
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset. This indicates a strong ability to predict credit card defaults.

**Future Work:**
**The future planning is:**

Explore advanced feature engineering techniques
Experiment with ensemble methods
Deploy the model as a web application
Collect more data to improve model performance
